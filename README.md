This project takes x-ray scans from hospital data of patientsa who had etiehr pneumonia, Covid-19 or no illness.
I used tensorflow (keras) to to create a classification model that outputs a diagnosis based on the patients x-ray scan.
This is a CNN, using convulutional layers and max pooling to create predictions.
Uses data from https://www.kaggle.com/pranavraikokte/covid19-image-dataset.
